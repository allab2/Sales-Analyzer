# 📊 CSV Sales Data Analyzer

This project is a **Python-based data analysis tool** that reads sales data from a CSV file and generates insights like total revenue, top-selling products, monthly trends, and daily order counts. It is perfect for demonstrating file I/O, data aggregation, and date-based analysis for interview projects or GitHub profile building.

## 🧠 Features

- Computes **total revenue** and **record count**
- Identifies **top 5 products** by quantity sold
- Aggregates **monthly revenue and units sold**
- Tracks **daily order counts**
- Handles **invalid date formats** gracefully
- Outputs results into a clean and readable text report

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place your sales data file as `sales_data.csv` in the project directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python analyzer.py
````

4. The output will be written to `sales_report.txt`.

## 📄 CSV File Format

The input CSV (`sales_data.csv`) should have the following columns:

| Column   | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Product  | Name of the product sold  |
| Quantity | Units sold (integer)      |
| Price    | Price per unit (float)    |
| Date     | Date of sale (YYYY-MM-DD) |

Example:

```csv
Product,Quantity,Price,Date
Widget A,5,19.99,2025-07-15
Gadget B,3,24.50,2025-07-15
```

## ✅ Sample Output (`sales_report.txt`)

```
------ Sales Metrics ------
Total Records: 200
Total Revenue: $3982.45

------ Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold ------
Widget A: 55 units
Gadget B: 47 units
...

------ Monthly Revenue and Units ------
2025-06: $1420.75, 89 units
